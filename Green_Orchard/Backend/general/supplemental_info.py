            'Question': 'How do I use Green Orchard?',
            'Answer': 'To begin, sign up for an account on this page or log in if you have already made an account. Upon logging in, your CSV file(s) from your banks will be retrieved and uploaded. This will pull all of your expenses into Green Orchard and automatically generate tables and charts that sort and display your expenditures for review.',
        },
        {
            'Question': 'What is the purpose of Green Orchard?',
            'Answer': 'The goal of Green Orchard is to make it simple and painless to see where your money is going.

The combination of interactive charts and detailed tables which categorically display your expenses will bring you a renewed sense of clarity about your financial life.'

            'Question': 'What can I do with the pie chart and bar chart?',
            'Answer': 'The pie chart breaks down your expenses by displaying how much you have spent in each category on a monthly basis. Clicking a category will break down exactly which expenses have gone into it for a given month, and you can cycle through the months with the arrows at the bottom of the page. The bar chart gives another view of your past expenses by displaying the total amounts spent in each category over the entirety of your bank files, rather than breaking them up by month.',

It is used for the sole purpose of generating the charts and tables representing your expenses. Green Orchard\'s purpose is to serve as a tool for users to get a better sense of their recent financial history, not to track your data or anything of that nature; your data is in safe hands!',
